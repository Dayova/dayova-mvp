# Product and Learning Domain Context

This context covers Dayova's product language, learning model, user journeys, content taxonomy, quizzes, study sessions, progress, and other domain concepts.

Confluence is the current cross-functional documentation hub. Keep this file focused on implementation-facing terminology and assumptions that agents need while working in this repo.

## Glossary

**Validation Phase**:
A focused learning period where Dayova is tested with a small number of students who have real school deadlines, to learn whether the product causes earlier and more committed action.
_Avoid_: Treating generic app usage, polite feedback, or TestFlight downloads as validation.

**First Real Block**:
The first genuine learning or work block a student starts for a real exam, assignment, presentation, or graded task before the last possible moment.
_Avoid_: Counting planning-only activity or artificial test tasks as this signal.

**Product Signal**:
Observed behavior that suggests Dayova itself helped the student act, such as starting a slot without a personal check-in, returning voluntarily, or entering a second real use case.
_Avoid_: Mixing this with action triggered by a founder or coach message.

**Accountability Signal**:
Observed behavior that happens reliably after a personal check-in or reminder, showing that accountability may be part of the product value.
_Avoid_: Treating check-in-driven action as pure product-loop success.

**Core Loop**:
The product behavior loop of entering a real task, seeing the next step, starting, documenting the result, replanning after failure, and returning.
_Avoid_: Describing the loop as app engagement or calendar usage.

**Recovery Loop**:
The part of the Core Loop where a missed or failed slot is explained, made smaller or replanned, and attempted again.
_Avoid_: Treating missed slots only as churn or lack of motivation.
